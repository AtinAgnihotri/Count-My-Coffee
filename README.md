# COUNT MY COFFEE

An iOS App that tells user when to have their last coffee for a good night's sleep based on these three questions :

    1. When do they want to wake up?
    2. Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
    3. How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

Made with SwiftUI and CoreML
